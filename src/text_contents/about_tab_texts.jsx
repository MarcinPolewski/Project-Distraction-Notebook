        "In a world full of endless notifications, constant noise, and scattered thoughts, staying focused feels impossible. But what if you had a place to capture distractions, clear your mind, and regain control over your attention?",
        "When you’re working, keep your distraction notebook within reach. Whenever a disruptive thought comes (like ‘I forgot to call back John,’ or ‘I need to read about this topic, seems interesting’), simply write it down, continue with your focus session, and address it later! It’s as simple as that.",
        "Distraction Notebook is your personal tool to declutter your thoughts and sharpen your focus. Instead of letting interruptions derail your flow, jot them down and return to what truly matters. Think clearer, work smarter, and stay in control—one note at a time.",
        "Everybody",
        "Yes, I've tried"
